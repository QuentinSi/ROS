This project is for the WidowX Xm430 robot. The WidowX XM430 Robot Turret is a fully programmable pan and tilt system designed around the DYNAMIXEL servos from Robotis.The servos offer a high resolution of 4096 positions and user a definable PID parameters. Temperature monitoring, positionnal feedback as well as voltage levels, load and compliance settings are all user accessible as well.

Let's look at its performance graph:

The pckg folder is the package where we will find the source files, messages, CMakeLists and package.xml.

This project was used to be able to have control over this turret. This is why you will find all the necessary information in this package to make this project work, continue it, test it or improve it.
